# Hello World and Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post built using **Next.js** and **MDX**. I love how Next.js makes it so much easier to build out full stack apps.

## Why MDX as Opposed to MD?

MDX is interesting because it works like regular Markdown, but it also has embed React components directly in the posts.
Example:

<div
  style={{
    padding: '20px',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    margin: '20px 0',
  }}
>
  This is what I mean by embed React components in Markdown!
</div>

## Code Examples

Here are some code exmaples:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!'
console.log(greeting)

function createBlog() {
  return 'Dev blog!!'
}
```

## What's Next?

I will keep working on my blog to learn more.

Stay tuned!
