# Hello World and Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post built using **Next.js** and **MDX**. I love how Next.js makes it so much easier to build out full stack apps.

## Why MDX as Opposed to MD?

MDX is interesting because it works like regular Markdown, but it also has embed React components directly in the posts.
Example:

<div
  style={{
    padding: '24px',
    background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)',
    color: 'white',
    borderRadius: '12px',
    margin: '24px 0',
    boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)',
    fontWeight: '500'
  }}
>
  This is what I mean by embed React components in Markdown! Mixing React and MDX is so cool!
</div>

## Code Examples

Here are some code examples:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!'
console.log(greeting)

function createBlog() {
  return 'Dev blog!!'
}
```

## Lists Work As Well

Example of a list:
- Item 1
- Item 10
- Item 300

## What's Next?

I will keep working on my blog to learn more.

Stay tuned!
