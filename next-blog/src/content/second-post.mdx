# The Dreaded Second Post

The second post on this journey has been hard to write for me. Thinking about what to write about while so much is happening in our country has been hard. It is hard to focus on technical growth when our generation's future may be getting mortgaged away by the GOP to provide tax cuts to the top 1%.

I will provide more about what I learned about **nextJS** as an update and follow up to this post. Right now, the mind is buzzing.

An idea that I had recently, has been to move my blog from relying on MDX to supporting a backend database, possibly PostgreSQL.

Thanks for your time,
Muugii M.
